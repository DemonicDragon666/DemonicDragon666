👋 Hi, I’m @DemonicDragon666
- 👀 I am a total rookie..lol. I want to learn everything! There is so much to learn though. I would like to contribute as well, at some point. Ohhh where to start...

 I’m interested in learning more about the best way to stay secure and anonymous. I am thinking of installing TAILS and also considering Linux rather than any proprietary software. Huge learning curve! I hope that I am putting this info in correctly. I am hoping to find advice and recommendations. Thanks everyone!
